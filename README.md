# Zombie Home Invasion VR
A room-scale virtual reality game for the HTC Vive that places you in a post apocalyptic zombie world. Your goal is to defend a house from a zombie horde by manipulating your environment.

### About

This is the C++ side of a game I built using Unreal Engine 4. The game began as my final project for the Galvanize Full Stack program. I've since been updating it and adding new features.
